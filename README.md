# leaf_photosyn

This repository contains a leaf-level photosynthesis model that can be used to explore effects of thermal acclimation, mesophyll conductance, and changes in the Jmax/Vcmax ratio, among other mechanisms. 

It accompanies the manuscript by Knauer et al. 2023 'Higher global gross primary productivity under future climate with more advanced representations of photosynthesis' (under Review).

The main script is run_photosyn.R, which calls functions (including the main function photosyn()) from script photosyn_functions.R.

For questions and comments please contact Dr. Juergen Knauer (J.Knauer@westernsydney.edu.au).
